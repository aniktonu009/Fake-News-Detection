Fake News Predictions

In this project, We are building a Fake News Prediction System using Machine Learning with Python. We will be using the Logistic Regression model for prediction. First, we need to collect the news data. We basically use a label data set so it consists of several thousand news articles, and it will be labeled as either it is real news or fake news such as
the author of that news, the title of the news, etc.
So, let's try to understand how we are going to do this. First, letâ€™s see the workflow of this project.

1.	In preprocessing we need to convert text news to a meaningful number that the computer can understand
2.	Then we do split data into train and test.
3.	Then we use a logistic regression model for prediction because its work well into binary classification
